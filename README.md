# Dungeon Dash

This game was developed as part of research in games for visually impaired children, for the course Sound and Media Technology at the Utrecht University.
The objective of this project was to develop a game where both normal children and visually impaired children could play together at the same level, while still being appealing to normal children.

Inspired in Geomtry Dash, Dungeon Dash is an autorunner rhythm game, where the player has to avoid traps and enemies by timing certain actions to the beat of the song thats playing. The player has 3 actions, jumping, sliding, and attacking, which are used, respectively, to avoid floor traps, avoid ceiling traps, and kill enemies. For fairness, we tried to conceal visual info, and give each action their own warning sound which plays X beats before.

In this research, we compare different sizes of the delay between the warning sound and the action window, to try to find a delay thats gives both player types a reasonable challenge and minimize normal player advantage. This prototype has 3 variations of the same level: 4 beats delay, 2 beats delay, and 1 beat delay.
